  abstract = {\textcopyright{} 2019 IEEE. A seamless communication capability is important in military operations. Likewise, enhanced security, increased capacity, and robust communication mechanisms are vital for humanitarian and disaster-response operations. Often, a system of wide-band satellites is employed for real-time exchange of information and over-the-horizon control, but the communications are prone to denial of service (DoS) attacks, and delayed redeployment. Hence, a swarm of drones could be deployed in mission-critical operations in times of urgency for a secured and robust distributed-intercommunication which is essential for survivability and successful completion of missions. In this paper, a distributed-agent-based framework for secure and reliable information exchange between drones in a constellation is proposed. The framework comprises a mechanism for path planning simulation and estimation, a flexible network architecture for improved client-server(C/S) and peer-to-peer (P2P) connectivity, as well as agents for identity authentications and secure communications. The framework has been simulated and verified with results showing promise.},

Web-based cyber-attacks have increased exponentially along with the growth of cloud-based web application technologies. Web browsers provide users with an entry point to these web applications. The iCrawl system is designed to deliver a high interaction honey client that is virtually indistinguishable from a real human-driven client. The system operates by driving an actual web browser in a fashion closely resembling a genuine user's actions. Unlike most crawlers iCrawl attempts to operate over visual elements on the web page, not code elements. The honeypot system consists of pre-configured decoy virtual machines. Each virtual machine includes spider program, which upon execution automates the process of driving the web browser and crawling the targeted website. It performs browsing by observing the page and simulating human user input through mouse and keyboard activity. The data collected from the crawling is stored in a graph database in the form of nodes and relations. This data captures the context and the changes in system behavior due to interaction with the crawled website. The graph data can be queried and monitored online for structural patterns and anomalies. The iCrawl system is enabling technology for studying sophisticated malicious websites that can avoid detection by the simpler crawlers typically utilized by well-known security companies.},

  abstract = {Over the past few years, the importance of video surveillance in securing national critical infrastructure has significantly increased, with applications including the detection of failures and anomalies. Accompanied by the proliferation of video is the increasing number of attacks against surveillance systems. Among the attacks, False Frame Injection (FFI) attacks that replay video frames from a previous recording to mask the live feed has the highest impact. While many attempts have been made to detect FFI frames using features from the video feeds, video analysis is computationally too intensive to be deployed on-site for real-time false frame detection. In this paper, we investigated the feasibility of FFI attacks on compromised surveillance systems at the edge and propose an effective technique to detect the injected false video and audio frames by monitoring the surveillance feed using the embedded Electrical Network Frequency (ENF) signals. An ENF operates at a nominal frequency of 60 Hz/50 Hz based on its geographical location and maintains a stable value across the entire power grid interconnection with minor fluctuations. For surveillance system video/audio recordings connected to the power grid, the ENF signals are embedded. The time-varying nature of the ENF component was used as a forensic application for authenticating the surveillance feed. The paper highlights the ENF signal collection from a power grid creating a reference database and ENF extraction from the recordings using conventional short-time Fourier Transform and spectrum detection for robust ENF signal analysis in the presence of noise and interference caused in different harmonics. The experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of ENF signal detection and/or abnormalities for FFI attacks.},

  abstract = {\textcopyright{} 2018 IEEE. While the smart surveillance system enhanced by the Internet of Things (IoT) technology becomes an essential part of Smart Cities, it also brings new concerns in security of the data. Compared to the traditional surveillance systems that is built following a monolithic architecture to carry out lower level operations, such as monitoring and recording, the modern surveillance systems are expected to support more scalable and decentralized solutions for advanced video stream analysis at the large volumes of distributed edge devices. In addition, the centralized architecture of the conventional surveillance systems is vulnerable to single point of failure and privacy breach owning to the lack of protection to the surveillance feed. This position paper introduces a novel secure smart surveillance system based on microservices architecture and blockchain technology. Encapsulating the video analysis algorithms as various independent microservices not only isolates the video feed from different sectors, but also improve the system availability and robustness by decentralizing the operations. The blockchain technology securely synchronizes the video analysis databases among microservices across surveillance domains, and provides tamper proof of data in the trustless network environment. Smart contract enabled access authorization strategy prevents any unauthorized user from accessing the microservices and offers a scalable, decentralized and fine-grained access control solution for smart surveillance systems.},

  abstract = {\textcopyright{} 2019 SPIE. Video Surveillance Systems (VSS) have become an essential infrastructural element of smart cities by increasing public safety and countering criminal activities. A VSS is normally deployed in a secure network to prevent the access from unauthorized personnel. Compared to traditional systems that continuously record video regardless of the actions in the frame, a smart VSS has the capability of capturing video data upon motion detection or object detection, and then extracts essential information and send to users. This increasing design complexity of the surveillance system, however, also introduces new security vulnerabilities. In this work, a smart, real-time frame duplication attack is investigated. We show the feasibility of forging the video streams in real-time as the camera's surroundings change. The generated frames are compared constantly and instantly to identify changes in the pixel values that could represent motion detection or changes in light intensities outdoors. An attacker (intruder) can remotely trigger the replay of some previously duplicated video streams manually or automatically, via a special quick response (QR) code or when the face of an intruder appear in the camera field of view. A detection technique is proposed by leveraging the real-time electrical network frequency (ENF) reference database to match with the power grid frequency.},

This paper proposes a Lightweight Environmental Fingerprint Consensus based detection of compromised smart cameras in edge surveillance systems (LEFC). LEFC is a partial decentralized authentication mechanism that leverages Electrical Network Frequency (ENF) as an environmental fingerprint and distributed ledger technology (DLT). An ENF signal carries randomly fluctuating spatio-temporal signatures, which enable digital media authentication. With the proposed DLT consensus mechanism named Proof-of-ENF (PoENF) as a backbone, LEFC can estimate and authenticate the media recording and detect byzantine nodes controlled by the perpetrator. The experimental evaluation shows feasibility and effectiveness of proposed LEFC scheme under a distributed byzantine network environment.},

  abstract = {With the fast development of Fifth-/Sixth-Generation (5G/6G) communications and the Internet of Video Things (IoVT), a broad range of mega-scale data applications emerge (e.g., all-weather all-time video). These network-based applications highly depend on reliable, secure, and real-time audio and/or video streams (AVSs), which consequently become a target for attackers. While modern Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology is integrated with many multimedia applications to help enhance its applications, the development of General Adversarial Networks (GANs) also leads to deepfake attacks that enable manipulation of audio or video streams to mimic any targeted person. Deepfake attacks are highly disturbing and can mislead the public, raising further challenges in policy, technology, social, and legal aspects. Instead of engaging in an endless AI arms race ``fighting fire with fire'', where new Deep Learning (DL) algorithms keep making fake AVS more realistic, this paper proposes a novel approach that tackles the challenging problem of detecting deepfaked AVS data leveraging Electrical Network Frequency (ENF) signals embedded in the AVS data as a fingerprint. Under low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) conditions, Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) and Multiple Signal Classification (MUSIC) spectrum estimation techniques are investigated to detect the Instantaneous Frequency (IF) of interest. For reliable authentication, we enhanced the ENF signal embedded through an artificial power source in a noisy environment using the spectral combination technique and a Robust Filtering Algorithm (RFA). The proposed signal estimation workflow was deployed on a continuous audio/video input for resilience against frame manipulation attacks. A Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) approach was selected to minimize the false positive rate of signal correlations. Extensive experimental analysis for a reliable ENF edge-based estimation in deepfaked multimedia recordings is provided to facilitate the need for distinguishing artificially altered media content.},

In today's networked surveillance environment, however, human operators are often overwhelmed with the huge amount of visual feeds, which causes poor judgment and delayed response to emergencies. This paper proposes a distributed crawler scheme (DiCrawler) for smart surveillance systems deployed on Internet of Video Things (IoVT). The IoVT camera nodes monitor continuous video input, track the object of interest while preserving privacy, and relay correlative information to targeted nodes for constant monitoring. Each IoVT node monitors the space inside its field of view (FoV) and notifies the neighboring nodes about the objects leaving the FoV and heading in their directions. A smart communication algorithm among IoVT nodes is designed to prevent network bandwidth bottlenecks and preserve computational power. The DiCrawler system can corroborate with human operators and assist with decision-making by raising alarms in case of suspicious behavior. The IoVT network is completely decentralized, using only peer-to-peer (P2P) communication. DiCrawler does not rely on a central server for any computations, preventing a potential bottleneck if hundreds of cameras were connected and constantly uploading data to a server. Each module is also in a compact form factor, making it viable to be mounted on traditional security surveillance cameras. Extensive experimental study on a proof-of-concept prototype validated the effectiveness of the DiCrawler design.},

This chapter presents an overview of the attack vectors designed to compromise intelligent surveillance systems and discusses existing detection techniques. With advanced machine learning (ML) models and computing resources, both attack vectors and detection techniques have evolved to use ML-based techniques more effectively, resulting in non-equilibrium dynamics. The current detection techniques vary from training a neural network to detect forgery artifacts to use the intrinsic and extrinsic environmental fingerprints for any manipulations.

Nowadays, a prohibitively large amount of surveillance data is being generated continuously by ubiquitously distributed video sensors. It is very challenging to immediately identify the objects of interest or zoom in suspicious actions from thousands of video frames. Making the big data indexable is critical to tackle this problem. It is ideal to generate pattern indexes in a real-Time, on-site manner on the video streaming instead of depending on the batch processing at the cloud centers. The modern edge-fog-cloud computing paradigm allows implementation of time sensitive tasks at the edge of the network. The on-site edge devices collect the information sensed in format of frames and extracts useful features. The near-site fog nodes conduct the contextualization and classification of the features. The remote cloud center is in charge of more data intensive and computing intensive tasks. However, exchanging the index information among devices in different layers raises security concerns where an adversary can capture or tamper with features to mislead the surveillance system. In this paper, a blockchain enabled scheme is proposed to protect the index data through an encrypted secure channel between the edge and fog nodes. It reduces the chance of attacks on the small edge and fog devices. The feasibility of the proposal is validated through intensive experimental analysis.},

The impacts of adversarial perturbations have led to the development of advanced techniques for generating image-level perturbations. Once embedded in a clean image, these perturbations are not perceptible to human eyes and fool a well-trained deep learning (DL) convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier.

The more oversight UAVs require, the less likely they are going to be commercially advantageous when compared to their alternatives. As an autonomous system, how much human interaction is needed to function is one of the best indicators evaluating the limitations and inefficiencies of the UAVs. Popular UAV related research areas, such as path planning and computer vision, have enabled substantial advances in the ability of drones to act on their own. This research is dedicated to in-flight operations, in which there is not much reported effort to tackle the problem from the aspect of the supportive infrastructure. In this paper, an Autonomous Service network infrastructure (AutoServe) is proposed. Aiming at increasing the future autonomy of UAVs, the AutoServe system includes a service-oriented landing platform and a customized communication protocol. This supportive AutoServe infrastructure will autonomize many tasks currently done manually by human operators, such as battery replacement.

  abstract = {Video cameras have been pervasively deployed in Smart Cities and timely processing of the huge amount of video data brings up new challenges. Each individual camera is only able to cover a limited range due to the effective monitoring distances and the complicated layout of a building or an area. Once the object of interest moves away from the camera field of view, the system may lose object tracking. When the object appears and is captured by another camera, object detection, feature abstraction, and behavior classification require an association with other video data exploitation results. Hence, pragmatic approaches for object re-verification (or re-acquisition) are needed so as to not infer the object as a new track. In this paper, we propose a novel Collaborative Multi-Object Tracking system as an Edge service (CoMOTE) based on transfer learning technology. A transfer learning-based human detection and tracking method is introduced, which allocates most of the computing tasks on edge devices. An edge server is adopted to integrate information from edge cameras for decision-making to enable multi-view surveillance. The CoMOTE scheme not only reduces the dependence on a central server but also leads to a lower communication cost. Implemented on edge nodes (Raspberry Pi 4) and tested with WildTrack multi-view video database, extensive experimental results verify that the CoMOTE prototype achieved the design goal and outperforms multiple state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

  abstract = {Video cameras have been pervasively deployed in Smart Cities and timely processing of the huge amount of video data brings up new challenges. Each individual camera is only able to cover a limited range due to the effective monitoring distances and the complicated layout of a building or an area. Once the object of interest moves away from the camera field of view, the system may lose object tracking. When the object appears and is captured by another camera, object detection, feature abstraction, and behavior classification require an association with other video data exploitation results. Hence, pragmatic approaches for object re-verification (or re-acquisition) are needed so as to not infer the object as a new track. In this paper, we propose a novel Collaborative Multi-Object Tracking system as an Edge service (CoMOTE) based on transfer learning technology. A transfer learning-based human detection and tracking method is introduced, which allocates most of the computing tasks on edge devices. An edge server is adopted to integrate information from edge cameras for decision-making to enable multi-view surveillance. The CoMOTE scheme not only reduces the dependence on a central server but also leads to a lower communication cost. Implemented on edge nodes (Raspberry Pi 4) and tested with WildTrack multi-view video database, extensive experimental results verify that the CoMOTE prototype achieved the design goal and outperforms multiple state-of-the-art methods.},
